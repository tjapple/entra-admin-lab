# Microsoft Entra ID Administration Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates practical, real-world identity administration skills in Microsoft Entra ID. The focus is on cloud-only identity operations, MFA management, user lifecycle management, security hygiene, and troubleshooting.

This lab does **not** rely on Microsoft 365 licensing. All workflows are performed directly in Entra ID using a cloud-only tenant, reflecting the modern identity foundation behind Microsoft 365 and Azure.

---

## Objectives
- Build operational competence with Microsoft Entra ID
- Perform common IT support tasks (user login failures, password resets, MFA lockouts, account disablement)
- Develop professional documentation for identity operations
- Understand the relationship between AD DS, Entra ID, Azure, and Microsoft 365
- Practice MSP-style troubleshooting using Sign-In Logs and Authentication Methods

---

## Core Skills Demonstrated
- User lifecycle management (create, disable, offboard)
- Group-based access control
- MFA resets using Temporary Access Pass (TAP)
- Authentication method management
- Log analysis (Sign-in logs, activity details)
- Guest onboarding workflows
- Least-privilege role assignment
- Security Defaults awareness
- Identity troubleshooting methodology used by support engineers

## Why This Lab Matters
M365 administration practice is inaccessible due to licensing. Even so, Entra ID itself provides the foundation for:

- Azure resource access  
- Microsoft 365 authentication  
- Single Sign-On (SSO)  
- MFA and Conditional Access  
- Device identity  

Understanding Entra ID means understanding the backbone of Microsoft’s entire cloud ecosystem.

## Future Extensions (Optional)
If licensing becomes available later, this lab can expand into:

- Exchange Online: mailboxes, shared mailboxes, message trace  
- SharePoint / Teams administration  
- Microsoft 365 Groups  
- Conditional Access enforcement (beyond Security Defaults)  
- Identity Governance (P2): access reviews, entitlement management  

The current project is intentionally scoped to identity fundamentals.

This repository was created as part of my hands-on practice to build strong IT support and identity administration skills for MSP-level work, focusing on problem-solving, security, and cloud-first identity operations.
